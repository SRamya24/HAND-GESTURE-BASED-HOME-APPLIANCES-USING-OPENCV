# HAND-GESTURE-BASED-HOME-APPLIANCES-USING-OPENCV
This project introduces an innovative solution for controlling home appliances using hand gestures, combining computer vision and embedded systems. By leveraging OpenCV, the system captures and interprets gestures in real-time, enabling wireless control of devices through an Arduino-based interface.
